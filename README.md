# PERFORMANCE-HUB
By: Gonzales Official

Safe, client-side Performance Hub for Roblox (blue + green theme).
This project is a LocalScript designed to be used in **your own games or in Roblox Studio** to reduce client-side rendering load.

**Important:** This repository does NOT include any exploit, injector, or executor code and does NOT enable running code in other players' games. Use only in environments you control.

## Features
- Enter Key interface (type `555` to unlock)
- Get Key button (opens/shows Discord invite)
- Small, draggable tab (blue + green theme) after unlock
- Buttons: Anti-Lag, Boost FPS, Anti Overheat (client-side only)
- Minimize to thin top line; clicking the line restores the UI
- Close (X) destroys the GUI
- Footer: `By: Gonzales Official`

## Installation
1. Create a new repository named `PERFORMANCE-HUB`.
2. Add `performance_hub.lua` to the repository.
3. In Roblox Studio, add a **LocalScript** with the contents of `performance_hub.lua` inside `StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts` or `StarterGui`.
4. Play test in Studio to use the key box and unlock the hub.

## Usage
- At start: type `555` in the Enter Key box and press Enter or the OK button to unlock.
- Click **Get Key** to view the Discord link.
- After unlock: use the buttons to toggle client-side visual reductions.
